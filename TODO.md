# CodeBoard TODO Tasks

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues to Fix

### âœ… Task 1: Fix Content Overlapping in Downloaded Images
- **Issue**: When images are downloaded from the codeboard, content overlaps the container or doesn't appear as initially pasted
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED âœ…
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - âœ… Fixed canvas sizing calculations to properly account for all content
  - âœ… Added proper padding and margin calculations (60px padding, improved spacing)
  - âœ… Implemented dynamic canvas sizing based on actual content dimensions
  - âœ… Added better text measurement and line wrapping (24px line height, 8.4px char width)
  - âœ… Enhanced window shadows and styling for better visual quality
  - âœ… Improved minimum dimensions to prevent tiny exports

### âœ… Task 2: Implement Syntax Highlighting & Color Coding
- **Issue**: Content does not change color - no color coding for content even when language is changed
- **Priority**: HIGH  
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED âœ…
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - âœ… Added Prism.js for syntax highlighting with @types/prismjs
  - âœ… Implemented language-specific token parsing for 14+ languages
  - âœ… Added color mapping for different token types (keywords, strings, comments, numbers, operators, functions, etc.)
  - âœ… Made syntax highlighting work for both preview and export
  - âœ… Created theme-aware highlighting that adapts to selected theme colors
  - âœ… Real-time syntax highlighting updates when language changes
  - âœ… Overlay system in preview for proper syntax highlighting display

### âœ… Task 3: Fix Text Cursor Alignment Issues
- **Issue**: When text content was pasted, it wasn't aligned properly and cursor didn't appear on the same row as content
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED âœ…
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - âœ… Fixed overlay alignment between textarea and syntax highlighting display
  - âœ… Replaced Textarea component with native textarea to avoid styling conflicts
  - âœ… Added precise font and layout matching between input and display layers
  - âœ… Implemented scroll synchronization between textarea and background
  - âœ… Added CSS fixes for perfect text alignment
  - âœ… Disabled auto-features (spell check, auto-correct, etc.) for code editing

### âœ… Task 4: Fix Font Size Consistency Between Preview and Export
- **Issue**: When content is downloaded, the fontSize becomes smaller than initially pasted - interface should match pre and post download
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED âœ…
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - âœ… Fixed canvas font scaling issues with retina displays
  - âœ… Ensured font size consistency between preview (14px) and export (14px)
  - âœ… Matched line height exactly between interface (24px) and canvas rendering
  - âœ… Updated all font rendering in canvas (main code, terminal, badges) to use consistent sizing
  - âœ… Removed unnecessary font scaling that was causing size discrepancies
  - âœ… Verified character width and spacing match between preview and export

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Canvas Export Fixes:
1. âœ… Dynamic canvas sizing based on content (minimum 700px width, scales with content)
2. âœ… Proper text measurement with monospace fonts (SF Mono, Monaco, Inconsolata)
3. âœ… Better padding and margin calculations (60px outer, 30px inner padding)
4. âœ… Support for long lines and proper wrapping
5. âœ… Enhanced shadow effects and visual styling
6. âœ… Language-aware file extensions in terminal prompt
7. âœ… Improved window chrome with better macOS dots and badges

### Syntax Highlighting Features:
1. âœ… Support for 14+ programming languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, HTML, CSS, SQL, Shell, JSON)
2. âœ… Color-coded tokens (keywords, strings, comments, numbers, operators, functions, classes, properties, booleans)
3. âœ… Theme-aware highlighting colors (5 themes: Dracula, Nord, Monokai, One Dark, Tokyo Night)
4. âœ… Consistent highlighting between preview and export
5. âœ… Real-time highlighting updates
6. âœ… Recursive token parsing for nested syntax elements
7. âœ… Fallback handling for unsupported languages

### Files Created/Modified:
- âœ… `/lib/syntax-highlighter.ts` - Complete syntax highlighting system with font size parameter
- âœ… `/app/page.tsx` - Updated with highlighting integration, improved export, and font consistency fixes
- âœ… `/app/global.css` - Added CSS for text alignment and code editor styling
- âœ… `package.json` - Added prismjs and @types/prismjs dependencies

### Performance Optimizations:
- âœ… Efficient token parsing with caching
- âœ… Optimized canvas rendering
- âœ… Proper memory management for blob URLs
- âœ… Responsive highlighting updates
