# ðŸŽ‰ CodeBoard Issues - RESOLVED

## Summary
Both critical issues with the CodeBoard application have been successfully identified and fixed:

## âœ… Issue 1: Content Overlapping in Downloaded Images - FIXED
**Problem**: Images exported from CodeBoard had content that overlapped containers or didn't appear as originally pasted.

**Root Cause**: Fixed canvas dimensions and improper content sizing calculations.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Dynamic canvas sizing that scales with actual content
- Improved padding calculations (60px outer, 30px inner)
- Better text measurement using proper monospace font metrics
- Enhanced line height (24px) and character width (8.4px) calculations
- Minimum canvas dimensions to prevent tiny exports
- Improved visual styling with better shadows and window chrome

## âœ… Issue 2: No Syntax Highlighting - FIXED  
**Problem**: Code appeared in single color with no syntax highlighting, even when language was changed.

**Root Cause**: No syntax highlighting library or color-coding system was implemented.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added Prism.js syntax highlighting library
- Implemented comprehensive token parsing for 14+ languages
- Created theme-aware color schemes for 5 different themes
- Real-time syntax highlighting updates
- Consistent highlighting between preview and export
- Support for keywords, strings, comments, functions, classes, operators, and more

## ðŸ›  Technical Changes Made

### New Dependencies Added:
```bash
npm install prismjs @types/prismjs
```

### Files Created:
- `lib/syntax-highlighter.ts` - Complete syntax highlighting system
- `TODO.md` - Task tracking and completion status
- `TEST_CASES.md` - Comprehensive test cases for verification

### Files Modified:
- `app/page.tsx` - Integrated syntax highlighting and improved canvas export
- `package.json` - Added new dependencies

### Features Added:
1. **Syntax Highlighting**:
   - 14+ programming languages supported
   - Theme-aware color schemes
   - Real-time highlighting updates
   - Token-based parsing (keywords, strings, comments, etc.)

2. **Improved Canvas Export**:
   - Dynamic sizing based on content
   - Better padding and spacing
   - Enhanced visual styling
   - Language-aware file extensions
   - Improved window chrome

## ðŸ§ª Testing
The application is now running on `http://localhost:3000` and both issues have been resolved:

1. **Content Overlap**: Test with long code lines and various languages - content now fits perfectly
2. **Syntax Highlighting**: Test language changes and different code samples - colors now update correctly

## ðŸŽ¯ Results
- âœ… Images export with proper content boundaries
- âœ… Syntax highlighting works across all supported languages  
- âœ… Theme changes affect syntax colors appropriately
- âœ… Real-time preview matches exported output
- âœ… Professional-quality code visualization achieved

Both critical issues have been completely resolved! ðŸš€
