# Test Cases for CodeBoard Fixes

## ✅ Test Case 1: Content Overlap Issue Fixed

### Before:
- Canvas sizing was fixed and didn't account for variable content length
- Long lines would overflow the container boundaries
- Downloaded images cut off text or had overlapping content

### After (Fixed):
- Dynamic canvas sizing based on actual content dimensions
- Proper padding and margins calculated automatically
- Content fits perfectly within the container boundaries
- Support for very long lines and multiple languages

### Test Steps:
1. Open CodeBoard at http://localhost:3000
2. Paste a long line of code (>100 characters)
3. Try different languages with varying content lengths
4. Export the image and verify all content is visible
5. Check that there's no overlap or cutoff

## ✅ Test Case 2: Syntax Highlighting Added

### Before:
- All code appeared in single color (theme text color)
- Language selection had no visual impact on code display
- No differentiation between keywords, strings, comments, etc.

### After (Fixed):
- Full syntax highlighting with Prism.js
- 14+ programming languages supported
- Color-coded tokens: keywords, strings, comments, numbers, operators
- Theme-aware highlighting colors
- Real-time highlighting updates when language changes

### Test Steps:
1. Open CodeBoard at http://localhost:3000
2. Paste JavaScript code - verify keywords are highlighted in pink/purple
3. Change language to Python - verify syntax colors update
4. Try different themes - verify highlighting colors adapt to theme
5. Export image and verify syntax highlighting is preserved
6. Test with different programming languages (TypeScript, Java, etc.)

## Sample Test Code:

### JavaScript:
```javascript
function calculateTotal(items) {
  // Calculate the total price
  const total = items.reduce((sum, item) => {
    return sum + (item.price * item.quantity);
  }, 0);
  
  const tax = total * 0.08;
  return { subtotal: total, tax, total: total + tax };
}
```

### Python:
```python
def process_data(data_list):
    """Process a list of data items"""
    result = []
    for item in data_list:
        if isinstance(item, str) and len(item) > 0:
            processed = item.strip().upper()
            result.append(processed)
    return result
```

### TypeScript:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  active?: boolean;
}

class UserService {
  private users: User[] = [];
  
  addUser(user: Omit<User, 'id'>): User {
    const newUser = { ...user, id: Date.now() };
    this.users.push(newUser);
    return newUser;
  }
}
```

## Expected Results:
- Keywords (function, def, class, interface, etc.) should be colored
- Strings should be in a different color
- Comments should be dimmed/grayed out
- Numbers should have their own color
- Operators and punctuation should be appropriately styled
- All content should fit within exported image boundaries
